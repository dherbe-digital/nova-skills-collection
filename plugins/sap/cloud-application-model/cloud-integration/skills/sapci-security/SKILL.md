## Task

$ARGUMENTS

## Your Approach

1. **Read the guideline file** to understand available security patterns
2. **Identify the security requirement** - What needs protection?
3. **Recommend specific patterns** from the guideline (e.g., CSRF protection, client certificates, message encryption)
4. **Provide implementation guidance** with concrete examples
5. **Highlight security risks** and mitigation strategies
6. **Never suggest hardcoding credentials** - always use secure credential storage

## Key Security Areas

- **Authentication**: CSRF protection, client certificates, mutual TLS
- **Data Protection**: Remove sensitive content, message digest, PII masking
- **Message Security**: Sign and encrypt messages, verify signatures
- **Secure Processing**: Encode parameters, disable DTDs, validate inputs
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage, certificate management, rotation

## Remember

- Always validate and sanitize inputs
- Use encryption for data in transit
- Log security events for auditing
- Regular security reviews and updates
